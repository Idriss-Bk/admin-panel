Getting Started with React App
This project was initialized using Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page reloads automatically when changes are made.
You may also see linting errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode for running tests.

npm run build
Builds the app for production, creating an optimized build folder.

The production build is minified, and filenames include hashes for better caching.
The app is ready for deployment.
Make sure to follow best practices for deploying your application efficiently.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Code Splitting
Code splitting allows you to optimize your application by loading only the necessary code when required, improving performance and user experience.

Analyzing the Bundle Size
Understanding your bundle size helps identify areas for optimization, ensuring your application remains fast and efficient.

Making a Progressive Web App (PWA)
A PWA enhances user experience by making your app installable, faster, and capable of working offline.

Advanced Configuration
For more flexibility, you can customize your project beyond the default setup to better suit your requirements.

Deployment
To make your application live, follow the recommended deployment practices for hosting and optimizing your build.

npm run build fails to minify
If you encounter issues while building your project, ensure that dependencies are correctly configured and check for any possible errors in your code.
